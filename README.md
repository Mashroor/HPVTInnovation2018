# Missouri S&T Human Powered Vehicle Team, 2018-2019 Innovation Repository
This will be used to store and update any software projects necessary for the HPVT Innovation team.

## Project Description
To create a system that will detect incoming crashes from behind the vehicle. This project will use LIDAR sensing and Arduino to detect such events.
### Purpose/Motivation
To create and present a cutting-edge/innovative concept for human powered vehicles. 
### Features
Will use Garmin's LIDAR-Lite v3 sensor to detect collision
Calculation and control will be done by an Arduino Micro
